# Fake-News-Detection
This is an attempt to detect Covid-related fake news (in Bengali language). We have experimented with BERT, XLM-RoBerta, Distilbert and several other transformer based models. Of course, we have made use of multilingual checkpoints. For now, I have only uploaded few notebooks containing pre-processing and model training steps. I will keep including files until the entire codebase is uploaded.
